Pollard is one of the better rotaters of strike among current West Indian batsmen. He is an unbelievably good fielder and will help to lift the standard of our fielding. His current batting average is not a true reflection of his ability and it will only get better if he plays more ODI cricket in this batsman-friendly era.

His ODI record does not merit a place on the squad. I will be even more controversial and question Darren Bravo's place on the side based on his ODI form for the past year.

Pollard made 69 runs in 7 innings, averaging 9.85 and a SR of 88. Top score of 30. 5 sixes. Is he really worth it? Remember he averages under 26 after 101 ODIs.

Who is to decide what the par score is ? In the age of T20s where the run rate is around 7 and upwards, fans wants and to see more boundaries. What we are seeing is the inevitable convergence of the playing styles of ODIs and T20s. I dont like it either, but we have to embrace it.\"\n\nNitol: \"As far as I can recall, Bangladesh did win a triangular series before! Didn't they win the triangular series at west indies played between Bangladesh, Bermuda and Canada in 2007, right before the world cup? I am sure that was International one day because Shakib's 134* against Canada is still his career best.\" -- Yes, but it didn't need a final to crown the title. It was a league-type tournament. Bangladesh have been awful in ODI finals\n\nCapitan Daniel: \"I'm not like the best knowing fan of cricket right now but you on cricinfo sure will help me with this: what happened with west indies superstars Pollard, DJ Bravo, Narine, why they don't play for the world cup?\" -- Well, they weren't quite in the team's radar under the previous WICB President, but a new President has seen them in the reckoning again. Narine, unfortunately, has an injured finger so isn't available for the World Cup. DJ Bravo hasn't been considered in the preliminary squad (and has since retired) while Pollard isn't yet in the squad, but we hear murmurs that he may just sneak into the 15 come May 23rd - the final day to announce squads\n\n<B>2.34pm</b> Our scorer Justin Smyth says that the rain has nearly stopped and the sun is (almost) sneaking out of the clouds. <B>The umpires are walking around</b>\n\nAK: \"Its pathetic to see batting paradise all around UK now a days. Some nation are making this ODI a format for batsman only. Team scoring 350 and then thats being chased down with 6-7 over spare. Utterly ridiculous!!!

This kind of pathetic pitch will make some mediocre batsman to the same bracket as the legend like Sangakara. \"\n\nJack: \"Perfect song for the current circumstance Srethth!

Hope....and then?\" -- I'm guessing they were initially going with something like Gayle, Lewis, Hope, Hetmyer, Darren Bravo, Russell, Holder, Nurse, Roach, Gabriel, Cottrell, with Allen coming in for one of the quicks depending on conditions. Let's see what their final squad is, now that the likes of Ambris and Campbell have put their hand up.\n\nAbhijato: \"The World Cup theme song premiered globally just a few minutes ago. Your thoughts about it?\" -- Just heard it. It's a nice song, but it doesn't give me proper World Cup feelz, you know what I mean?

Even Windies won't going to score 200 in 30th over. Ridiculous DL method to follow.\" -- Well, West Indies began their innings thinking they would need to bat 50 overs, which would obviously demand a very different approach than if they were going in with 10 wickets in hand and only 20 overs to play out. \n\n<b>2.00pm</b> Another update from Mr Smyth.\n\n<!--\nname: twitter\nurl: https://twitter.com/justinsmyth1/status/1129369483083173889\n-->\n\nMushfiq: \"If the game reduces to 20 overs, then what will be target for Bangladesh?\" -- Great question.

Also Ireland now being a Test nation should think about it so that Irish crowd can view more cricket at their home turf.

We Bangladeshis don't need the help of rain. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nVinod Rajpal: \"300 seconds for loosing one over ; How will they calculate Ravindra Jadeja's Over as he only takes 120 seconds for his over !!\"\n\n<B>1.08pm</b> <b>Confirmed:</b> We will start losing overs from 1.12pm. We will lose one over for every 4.50 minutes. And here's Sreshth back again. \n\nScott: \"What's the answer to Q1?? This rain massively benefits Bangladesh \" -- not sure whether Bangladesh would want to lift the trophy that way. They've beaten WI twice already and no reason why they can't win the match in itself\n\nAbdullah: \"As much as I want Bangladesh to win the tournament by winning today, I'll take the washout. Bangladeh really needs this. They've come so close so many times. Don't want it risking again. Come on rain. \"\n\nWhile we wait for an update, here's an interesting one - <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26766685/espncricinfo-readers-pick-their-all-world-cup-xi\" target=\"_blank\">the all-time World Cup XI as chosen by you</a>\n\nAnswer to Q2: Cricket Ireland has confirmed that <b>Bangladesh will lift the trophy in case of a no-result today</b>. Better results in the group stage. If it happens, it will be Bangladesh's first win in the final of a multi-team ODI tournament.\n\n\n\nAnswer to Q3: Nope; as such, this is the forecast for tomorrow: Mostly cloudy, showers around.\n\nQuestions<br>\n1. When do we start losing overs?<br>\n2. Who wins if we don't get a result today?<br>\n3. Do we have a reserve day?<br>\n\n- We're checking on these and will get back to you soonest\n\n<b>12.45pm</b> Justin Smyth's update from Malahide is: \"<b>The rain is slowing down</b>, so I'm hopeful that there will be more play. But it's just so cold, so there is no sun to help dry the ground.\"\n\nIt doesn't look good at all, unfortunately\n\n<!--\nname: twitter\nurl: https://twitter.com/Irelandcricket/status/1129350916891652096\n-->\n\nJack: \"Whilst be have you Shamya, who is your pick for WC glory??\"\n- Dunno, but they'll go back home with <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26766199/world-cup-2019-winners-get-us-4-million\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of money</a>\n\n<b>12.35pm</b> Here's the latest weather update\n\n<!--\nname: twitter\nurl: https://twitter.com/justinsmyth1/status/1129348651900428291\n-->\n\nFor people asking about Mahmudullah, here's Isam's update: \"He is on the mend, he is still a few weeks away from being cleared to bowl.\" Likely he will play as a batsman-only at the World Cup to start with.\n\nMikhail: \"Ambris is currently averaging 102 and can't make the world cup squad that's a bit tough\" - it is, isn't it? And that squad (which can change, of course) has Gayle and Lewis too.\n\nPaul Muchmore: \"Hi Shamya! Cricinfo ball by ball debut?\" - more like subbing for Sreshth while he takes a break for the rain.\n\n\"Mahmudullah has a problem in shoulder. That's why Mosaddek came into the squad. Mahmudullah won't bowl in the world cup either,\" says Farhan - messes with the team balance, doesn't it, if Mahmudullah doesn't bowl at all? \n\n<b>12.25pm</b> This might not mean a terribly long delay, just a passing shower hopefully. But we'll know only when we know.\n\n<B>12.13pm</b> And we're going off, folks. <B>Rain</b> getting heavier, and the covers are coming on. The players have hared off already. Time for Shamya Dasgupta to have a crack on commentary. Remember to tell him hi!\n\nUnderachiever: \"Seems like Masrafe does not rate Mahmudullah's tweaks. Surprising given he is usually tight and has the knack of breaking partnerships. Wonderful batting by Hope and Ambris.\"\n\nMashur: \"Oh! No rain no! Don't spoil the taste of watching Bangladesh chasing a 350+ score. Please stop asap!\"\n\nAdam: \"Is that Campbell guy injured or something? 150 in the first match and he didn't get another chance. seems harsh\" -- yes.
