Asghar Afghan wanted 250 at the toss, and they've got it. And it's not the top-order that's given them that, not the middle order, but the lower order - <b>a record eighth-wicket stand for them in ODIs</b> - that's taken them there.\n\nIt was sensational hitting. He came in with Afghanistan 160 for 7 and turned the tables on Bangladesh out of nowhere. But he's far from done. There's no doubt he will play an integral role with the ball. This is going to be no easy chase for Bangladesh. In fact, <b>no team has chased down more than 200 this Asia Cup.</b> That's the magnitude of the task in front of Bangladesh. And remember: they are without Tamim and without Mushfiqur, two of their seniormost batsmen. Will they find a new hero? Vishal will be with you in about 35 minutes for the chase.\n\n\"We're happy. We wanted to score 220-plus,\" says Hashmatullah Shahidi. \"In the end, Rashid and Gulbadin played well. It was an important partnership. We lost two early wickets. The Bangladesh bowlers bowled very tight lines, I tried to stay till the end but lost my wicket. The ball was coming on quite well to the bat, but the second innings won't be so easy to bat on. We wanted to score 220-plus, but we have 250-plus, so very happy.\"\n\nRamS: \"My honest observation being neutral. Afghanistan are probably the only team in my memory that have come up the ranks so quickly, challenging the top teams. They will be a force to wrecken with in the next 2-3 years. Very happy for Afg, keep going.\"\n\nNuur Hasan: \"And now there is every chance that the men to trouble Bangladesh most with the ball would be Naib and Rashid. It would be amazing if they are win the game with the ball with 3 or 4 wickets each. It would be an envious cricketing love story. \"", "shortText": "Mashrafe Mortaza to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs", "homeScore": "255/7", "awayScore": "0", "scoreValue": 4, "sequence": 104906, "athletesInvolved": [{"id": "56007", "name": "Mashrafe Mortaza", "shortName": "Mortaza", "displayName": "Mashrafe Mortaza"}, {"id": "793463", "name": "Rashid Khan", "shortName": "Rashid Khan", "displayName": "Rashid Khan"}], "speedKPH": "126.462", "speedMPH": "78.580", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "56007", "name": "Mashrafe Mortaza", "shortName": "Mortaza", "fullName": "Mashrafe Bin Mortaza", "displayName": "Mashrafe Mortaza"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 0, "balls": 48, "wickets": 0, "overs": 8.0, "conceded": 67}, "otherBowler": {"athlete": {"id": "550137", "name": "Abu Hider", "shortName": "Abu Hider", "fullName": "Abu Hider Rony", "displayName": "Abu Hider"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 1, "balls": 54, "wickets": 2, "overs": 9.0, "conceded": 50}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "793463", "name": "Rashid Khan", "shortName": "Rashid Khan", "fullName": "Rashid Khan Arman", "displayName": "Rashid Khan"}, "team": {"id": "40", "name": "Afghanistan", "abbreviation": "AFG", "displayName": "Afghanistan"}, "totalRuns": 57, "faced": 32, "fours": 8, "runs": 255, "sixes": 1}, "otherBatsman": {"athlete": {"id": "352048", "name": "Gulbadin Naib", "shortName": "Gulbadin", "fullName": "Gulbadin Naib", "displayName": "Gulbadin Naib"}, "team": {"id": "40", "name": "Afghanistan", "abbreviation": "AFG", "displayName": "Afghanistan"}, "totalRuns": 42, "faced": 38, "fours": 5, "runs": 0, "sixes": 0}, "innings": {"id": "208611", "runRate": 5.1, "remainingBalls": 0, "byes": 0, "number": 1, "balls": 300, "noBalls": 0, "wickets": 7, "legByes": 0, "ballLimit": 300, "target": 0, "session": 1, "day": 1, "fallOfWickets": 0, "remainingOvers": 0.0, "totalRuns": 4, "wides": 0, "runs": 255}, "over": {"ball": 6, "balls": 6, "complete": true, "limit": 50.0, "maiden": 0, "noBall": 0, "wide": 0, "byes": 0, "legByes": 0, "number": 50, "runs": 19, "wickets": 0, "overs": 49.6, "actual": 49.6, "unique": 49.06}, "dismissal": {"dismissal": false, "bowled": false, "type": "", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "56007", "name": "Mashrafe Mortaza", "shortName": "Mortaza", "fullName": "Mashrafe Bin Mortaza", "displayName": "Mashrafe Mortaza"}}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "793463", "name": "Rashid Khan", "shortName": "Rashid Khan", "fullName": "Rashid Khan Arman", "displayName": "Rashid Khan"}}, "fielder": {"athlete": {}}, "minutes": 0, "retiredText": ""}}]}}
