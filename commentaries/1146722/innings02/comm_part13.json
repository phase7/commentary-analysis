We lost momentum in the middle, but credit to Gayle and Rovman for giving us a chance, but we just weren't able to tick over the scoreboard. Credit also goes to Bangladesh. These days 300 is a par score, and we should've chased it down. Got a lot of work to do before the World Cup, but Hetmyer played well, Keemo came into his own, Chris was amazing and Rovman has been doing well. So a couple of positives.\"\n\n<b>Tamim Iqbal, the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series, says:</b> \"We didn't have a great Test series, so we practiced a lot. But this is a format we are comfortable in. What I wanted to do was bat long, my team asked me to bat long, so I did it successfully. The wicket in West Indies is never easy, but you have to be patient here. Patience is the key and that's why I got the big runs.\n\n<b>Mashrafe Mortaza, the winning captain:</b> \"Cricket is a mental game. But boys stepped up from the first ODI itself, but we played well for the most part of the game even when we lost in match 2. Boys are in good touch so the juniors need to step up too. Bowlers were good in all three games, and now we need to start the T20s confidently. West Indies are a great T20I team.\"\n\nTasmeem: \"The key thing for Bangladesh was that they had just a really slow innings, but sadly West Indies had two. Also the last 15 overs made the difference. Shai Hope was really slow, but the stat shows it's nothing new. May be the situation demanded a promotion for Rovman Powell and Holder, just like Mashrafe promoted himself.\"\n\nHridoy : \"Congratulations to BD tigers to win the series.

No consistent new players emerging to replace the seniors. All are hit or miss. Soumya. Shabbir, Anamul, Mosaddek, Mominul, just not cutting it. \"\n\nJahan: \"Let's not put the blame on Hope. What about Lewis' slow start. Or the lack of death bowling for WI in the first innings? All factors should be taken into consideration, not just the obvious. There are positives and negatives both sides can take going into the t20's\"\n\n\n\nrabbul: \"my man of the match is RUbel as he has habituated to give away 22 to 25 runs in penaltimate over but today gave away only 6 :)\"\n\nBelal: \"Phew! Got some dignity back. But we lost badly against Afghanistan in T20s and WI in tests. I fear for our team in the future, our mentality is not right. The seniors not interested in test cricket, makes me so badly upset. We won matches against Australia and England that gave me so much joy but then Sri Lanka beat us at home. Where are we going with this team.\"\n\n<B>5.28pm</b> The two captains now shake hands. West Indies played the series in a great spirit too. No shame in losing a closely-fought series. Rovman Powell pushed hard after Chris Gayle's fifty gave the hosts a good start. But a couple of slow batting performances in the middle-overs made things just too tough for Windies to forge a comeback. The visitors win 2-1, and we'll be back soon with the <b>presentation party.</b>\n\nSulaiman: \"Brisk 70 at the top and brisk 70 at the end it means t was Hope who lost the game for WI\"\n\nyanthan: \"when 4 of the top 5 scores less than 72 SR while chasing more than 6 RPO this is simply unacceptable. WI must learn to play more aggressive if want to be more competitive during WC19.\"\n\nSneh : \"Great game of cricket.. Fantastic series win for BD..need to mention about Powell's marvelous inning as well..he certainly deserves to bat one or two position higher in this lineup..Well contested series it was..!\"\n\nRakesh Sampat: \"Bangladesh were 259 and WI 262 at the end of the 47th over and it's the last 3 overs that the WI bowler's bowled with so much casualness that has come back to haunt them in the end and also Lewis forgetting that he was in a ODI and not a test match\"\n\n\n\nNaseef : \"Watching the game with sleepy eyes now!! I must say it was worth that!! What a match!! Some sheer power hitting from Rovman Powell almost took my sleep away!! I'll sleep peacefully now!! Goodnight!!\"\n\n\n<b>5.25 pm</b> Celebrations in Basseterre as Mehidy, Mahmudullah and Mortaza high-five each other. First series win for Bangladesh outside Asia since 2009. Smiles all around. The camera stays on Mashrafe Mortaza, who starred with the bat late in the innings and then led with the ball as well.
