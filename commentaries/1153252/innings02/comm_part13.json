We knew they had some good hitters an they held their nerve well but in the end we came out on top, so a good team effort. It always feels happy to contribute to the team. Me and Imrul had a good partnership. We were trying to get to the end. But in the end it was the bowlers who defended it. We have to bring our A-game for the Pakistan match.<br><br>\n\n<b>Mahmudullah is the Man of the Match.</b>\n\n<b>Mashrafe:</b> End of the match, Mustafiz was a magician. Lost so many matches  [where] couldn't score 8-9 runs but we defended it today. Hadn't given up - Shakib bowled really well in his last three balls. After that we told Mustafiz to look for wickets because they would have missed it. But first have to give credit to Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes. Mustafiz cramped a bit, <b>we wanted him to bowl 10 overs but he couldn't. Couldn't even bowl yorker because he had a cramp in his calf.</b> Hopefully we'll have a good crack at the virtual semi-final.<br><br>\n\n<b>Asghar Afghan</b>: Congratulations to Bangladesh. Painful game. 8 off 6 is not difficult because Rashid, Nabi, Shenwari can do it. But I will give credit to him, he bowled his variations. Everything was going to plan. Again we lost in the last over. Again the batsmen going for big shots at the end, which didn't work. We have learnt a lot, especially because we are playing against full-members.<br><br>\n\n<hr>\n\nMuhammad Awais: \"Cricket is a cruel game but we still love it...

Fairplay to Afghanistan for a brilliant show. Dhaka will not sleep tonight!\"<br><br>\n\n<b>11:37pm</b> Four off the last over. Bangladesh have held on. What a comeback win for them. They looked out of it halfway through their batting innings. There were moments where they seemed to have given it away with the ball as well, but they've done it. Mortaza was due to bowl the 46th over, but he decided to hand it to Mustafiz to get three overs out of him. Was that the turning point? Sure seems so now. <b>Afghanistan cannot qualify for the final any longer.</b> Mahmudullah, Imrul Kayes, Mashrafe and Mustafiz have got in their way.
