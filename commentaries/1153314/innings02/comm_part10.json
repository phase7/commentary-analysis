We will be back on Tuesday for the second ODI at this very venue.

It's not easy to score runs on this wicket. Liton played a nice knock, Shakib got some quick runs, that helped a lot. But I think Mushfiqur was brilliant, very professional. Still a long way to go for this team.\"  \n\n\"Hopefully, we can bounce back,\" says Rovman Powell. \"We didn't bat as well as we would have liked. I think the wicket became a little easier to bat later on. The senior guys and support staff is behind me.\"\n\nTime for the presentation ceremony.\n\n<b>8:05pm</b> A target of 196 achieved in 35.1 overs, a clinical performance with the ball setting up the five-wicket victory. Liton Das made 41 before throwing it away but Shakib Al Hasan made a breezy 30. Mushfiqur Rahim played the anchor's role and stayed unbeaten on 55 to see the side home. West Indies, on the other hand, were more reactive than active. If someone hit a boundary, off the went the slip. If there was an edge, a slip came in.
