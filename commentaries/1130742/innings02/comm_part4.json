Sri Lanka set up a final with the hosts. After having conceded 320 just six days ago, Sri Lanka, led by Lakmal, skittled Bangladesh for 82. They did not even need the services of Akila Dananjaya. Danushka and Tharanga then had some fun in the chase to close out the match.\n\n<b>Mashrafe</b>: Tamim and Shakib have been scoring runs. Mushy did well but hopefully the others will come up with good knocks. They are working hard, so we can't complain. Hopefully, the boys will deliver in the final. All the batters said it was a good wicket to bat on. Maybe the application wasn't there. It was a bad day and hopefully it does not count in the final.\n\n<b>Chandimal</b>: Before the game, we had gameplans, credit goes to the players. We got the energy in the bowling - especially Suranga. Upul and Danushka finished it off well. Credit to them also.\n\n<b>Lakmal is the Man of the Match</b>\n\nThat's a wrap of this match. Done in just 35.5 overs. Until next time, goodbye.\n\nLakpj: \"this 50 game and the NZ-Pak T20 match started at the same time. while the t20 game is still under way this game is done and dusted. \"\n\nAnver Azeez: \"A strong comeback by SL !! wish this will boost their confident before the Final !!\"", "shortText": "Mustafizur Rahman to Gunathilaka, 1 run", "homeScore": "0", "awayScore": "83/0", "scoreValue": 1, "sequence": 201105, "athletesInvolved": [{"id": "330902", "name": "Mustafizur Rahman", "shortName": "Mustafizur", "displayName": "Mustafizur Rahman"}, {"id": "345821", "name": "Danushka Gunathilaka", "shortName": "Guna", "displayName": "Danushka Gunathilaka"}], "speedKPH": "", "speedMPH": "", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "330902", "name": "Mustafizur Rahman", "shortName": "Mustafizur", "fullName": "Mustafizur Rahman", "displayName": "Mustafizur Rahman"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 0, "balls": 11, "wickets": 0, "overs": 1.5, "conceded": 14}, "otherBowler": {"athlete": {"id": "56143", "name": "Shakib Al Hasan", "shortName": "Shakib", "fullName": "Shakib Al Hasan", "displayName": "Shakib Al Hasan"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 0, "balls": 6, "wickets": 0, "overs": 1.0, "conceded": 10}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "345821", "name": "Danushka Gunathilaka", "shortName": "Guna", "fullName": "Mashtayage Danushka Gunathilaka", "displayName": "Danushka Gunathilaka"}, "team": {"id": "8", "name": "Sri Lanka", "abbreviation": "SL", "displayName": "Sri Lanka"}, "totalRuns": 35, "faced": 35, "fours": 3, "runs": 83, "sixes": 2}, "otherBatsman": {"athlete": {"id": "50747", "name": "Upul Tharanga", "shortName": "Tharanga", "fullName": "Warushavithana Upul Tharanga", "displayName": "Upul Tharanga"}, "team": {"id": "8", "name": "Sri Lanka", "abbreviation": "SL", "displayName": "Sri Lanka"}, "totalRuns": 39, "faced": 37, "fours": 1, "runs": 0, "sixes": 3}, "innings": {"id": "202249", "runRate": 7.01, "remainingBalls": 229, "byes": 0, "number": 2, "balls": 71, "noBalls": 0, "wickets": 0, "legByes": 0, "ballLimit": 300, "target": 83, "session": 1, "day": 1, "fallOfWickets": 0, "remainingOvers": 38.1, "totalRuns": 1, "wides": 0, "runs": 83}, "over": {"ball": 5, "balls": 5, "complete": false, "limit": 50.0, "maiden": 0, "noBall": 0, "wide": 0, "byes": 0, "legByes": 0, "number": 12, "runs": 2, "wickets": 0, "overs": 11.5, "actual": 11.5, "unique": 11.05}, "dismissal": {"dismissal": false, "bowled": false, "type": "", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "330902", "name": "Mustafizur Rahman", "shortName": "Mustafizur", "fullName": "Mustafizur Rahman", "displayName": "Mustafizur Rahman"}}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "345821", "name": "Danushka Gunathilaka", "shortName": "Guna", "fullName": "Mashtayage Danushka Gunathilaka", "displayName": "Danushka Gunathilaka"}}, "fielder": {"athlete": {}}, "minutes": 0, "retiredText": ""}}]}}
