We know our finalists, and now all we need to know is who will be crowned Asia's champion. That, we shall learn on friday, so see ya'll then? On behalf of all of us at ESPNcricinfo, this is Sreshth Shah signing off! Have a good night. \n\n<b> 11.52pm</b> Time for the presentation. \n\n<b>Mushfiqur Rahim, the Man of the Match:</b> \"It was important I kept belief in myself. And Mithun batted brilliantly too. I told him that we need to dig in after the early wickets. Credit goes to the way I practice and my preparation. That gives me confidence. I'm taking the right decisions more often.\" \n\n<b>Mashrafe Mortaza, the winning captain:</b> \"I think we changed our combination a bit. Usually I open the bowling, but today we started with Miraz. The bowlers did a good job, especially when we didn't get the runs. But Mushi and Mithun batted really well. We can be proud of our fielding today. Long time we haven't seen this quality of fielding in our time, so hopefully the boys can understand the value of good fielding. We still need to improve a bit of our batting and bowling. I was lucky that I didn't drop my catch, because Shoaib Malik was in such good form, but all over the fielding was really good. We always know that India are a serious side. We don't have Shakib and Tamim but hopefully the boys can show their character on friday.\" \n\nSami: \"Saw a friendly tournament for a change! Lots of positives to take from players and fan behaviors towards each other. Love for cricket is strong as ever in our subcontinent! Love from Bangladesh. \"\n\nRohan Trehan: \"Mushfiqur may be MOTM but lets not forget Mithun's contribution. I believe his innings was the difference as no other Pakistan batsman's score was even close to Imam's. He didn't have enough support.\"\n\n<b>Sarfraz Ahmed, the losing captain:</b> \"Not feeling good, but the performance wasn't good. As a captain, I didn't do well. So I think as a team and as a captain, I didn't lead well. We didn't field well, our batting collapsed and as a team we didn't do well in any department. Fakhar was our main player, Shadab and Nawaz had opportunities, but we need to play well if we need to win against good teams. Our batting collapse hurt us. Shaheen is our plus point.\" \n\n<b>11.40pm</b> It's yet another India-Bangladesh final at the Asia Cup! The result might show that it was a 37-run victory for Bangladesh, but Pakistan, led by Imam and Asif, fought hard for the most part. Both teams suffered early with the bat, with the pacers taking wickets up front to rattle batting orders, but eventually it will be Mushfiqur's 99 that will stand out on the scorecard. That innings was the difference today. The Bangladesh fans are delighted. BCB chief Nazmul Hassan congratulates his boys.\n\ndoctor: \"shoaib malik has already proved a pathetic captain and sarfaraz took the team to the top.after misbah. one shouldnt forget the disasterous situation of team from where sarfaraz took the team. few players needs replacement fawad alam instead of asif ali and team is good \"\n\nAbhishek Verma: \"This felt same as the English going on and on about \"It's coming back\" for the Football world Cup. Never count your eggs before they hatch.. \"\n\nImrul: \"BD deserves to be in the final. They lost their best batsman Tamim in the 1st match, lost Shakib before today's virtual semi-final. Still they beat every team bur India. AFG played well, Kudos to them. But you have to win your matches, which they did not...\"\n\nORPHIUS: \"Congratulation Bangladesh for making it to Final. And Kudos to them - they made it without their two best player Tamim and Sakib.\"\n\nUzair: \"I seriously believe it is time for Mickey Arthur to go. He has just not understand the level an type of cricket we play. Imagine Mickey asking Saeed Anwer to bat a certain way or asking Wasim Akram to bowl a certain way. I don't see players are getting the independence they need to show their talent. \"\n\nChinmay: \"@Imran - With all due respect. The recent past you are talking about is Zimbabwe and West indies.
