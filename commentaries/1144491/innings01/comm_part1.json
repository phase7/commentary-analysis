Now, It's only tigers time to show a memorable performance for their mad fans! \"\n\nAbhijato: \"Mr Brickhill, you're shifting comms feed duties faster than India are shifting through the Proteas batsmen. What's your prediction for this one? You're a neutral here, after all, so no jinxes either ways. What's your take?\" -- Oof!

As soon as that changes, I'll let you know\n\nBangladesh have a stiff challenge at hand given the overhead conditions and the form of the New Zealand pace attack that not only decimated Sri Lanka in Cardiff but also skittled India out for a paltry 179 in the warm-up at The Oval. On that note, it's time to turn over the strike to Liam Brickhill, who will take you through to drinks.\n\nRumman: \"How is the pitch? Any grass? What you feel can be a par score? \" It's a fresh pitch with reasonable grass cover.

If overcast, Bangladesh should field first given the chance. What's your opinion? \" The weather's likely to be cloudy for most of the day but it's a tough one given that Bangladesh's spinners could come into play later. Besides, this isn't the usual 10:30 am start.\n\nBangladesh have appeared quietly confident about the fact that they aren't merely making the numbers this time, the comfortable win over South Africa only reaffirming that. New Zealand, on the other hand were so dominant in their opener against Sri Lanka that it's almost hard to know what kind of form the majority of their players are in. The Oval pitch has been on the drier side, which should suit Bangladesh.\n\n\"Vibe outside is boisterous,\" Isam thunders as he makes his way to the ground.\n\n<b>12.20pm </b> Warm welcome to all of you for the second of our Wednesday double-headers.
