Apart from the two overs from Neesham that travelled for 24 runs, every bowler kept things tight. Santner picked up 1 for 41 on a pitch that isn't even really turning much, while there was also a wicket apiece for Ferguson and de Grandhomme. New Zealand's new-ball bowlers were even better, with Boult taking 2 for 44 (including his 150th ODI wicket - he's the second fastest to that mark after Saqlain Mushtaq) and Henry starring with 4 for 47, including two in two to end the innings. For Bangladesh, pretty much everyone in the top 8 got themselves in, but no-one could really kick on. Shakib top-scored with 64 in his 200th ODI, but there were also five batsmen who got into the 20s, and then got out. There were only 21 fours for Bangladesh today, a huge dip from the 37 they struck against South Africa, and that's also indicative of the splendid discipline with the ball and in the field by New Zealand. \nBangladesh don't have quite as many as they would have hoped for, but there's still a game on here. \n\n\"It was a little slower than we thought it would be,\" <b>Mitchell Santner</b> says of the pitch. \"We'll have to watch out for their bowlers, but we should be able to chase this. My role when it's not spinning is to dot it up through the middle, built up some pressure, and we cashed in later, which was good. It will be pretty good. The score is maybe a little below par, but the cutters are gripping in the surface, and they have some pretty good spinners too.\"\n\nSwarlok: \"Well, it was not an impressive performance from Bangladesh team. That Run Out was the worst of all. Tough one for Bangladesh bowlers. Still they can do it if Mehidy, Mashrafe and Mustafizur's cutter cut New Zealand's batting lineup.\"\n\nTaslim: \"I think 244 is a quite competitive score in this pitch.
