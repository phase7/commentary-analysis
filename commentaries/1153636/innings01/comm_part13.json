Little bit low, but if you play straight you can get runs. He (Mahmuddulah) has a knack of getting wickets, probably gave him that one. I play the reverse sweep a lot and generally make contact. Poor judgment at my end. If me and Williams had carried on we were looking at the 280-290 mark. Our fielding will have to be up there and very energetic. Their spinners didn't get a lot of purchase which means our spinners wont either. We'll have to hang in there and take everything that comes our way.\" \n\n<b>6.12pm</b> Zimbabwe were looking good when Taylor was at the crease, and they'll be mighty pleased with his return to form, but the innings never really took off once he fell. The batsmen couldn't get on top of the bowling, and this pitch looks pretty decent. Bangladesh should back themselves to chase this.", "shortText": "Mohammad Saifuddin to Mavuta, 2 runs", "homeScore": "246/7", "awayScore": "0", "scoreValue": 2, "sequence": 104906, "athletesInvolved": [{"id": "806239", "name": "Brandon Mavuta", "shortName": "Mavuta", "displayName": "Brandon Mavuta"}, {"id": "629070", "name": "Mohammad Saifuddin", "shortName": "Saifuddin", "displayName": "Mohammad Saifuddin"}], "speedKPH": "117.640", "speedMPH": "73.098", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "629070", "name": "Mohammad Saifuddin", "shortName": "Saifuddin", "fullName": "Mohammad Saifuddin", "displayName": "Mohammad Saifuddin"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 1, "balls": 60, "wickets": 3, "overs": 10.0, "conceded": 45}, "otherBowler": {"athlete": {"id": "330902", "name": "Mustafizur Rahman", "shortName": "Mustafizur", "fullName": "Mustafizur Rahman", "displayName": "Mustafizur Rahman"}, "team": {"id": "25", "name": "Bangladesh", "abbreviation": "BDESH", "displayName": "Bangladesh"}, "maidens": 0, "balls": 60, "wickets": 1, "overs": 10.0, "conceded": 35}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "806239", "name": "Brandon Mavuta", "shortName": "Mavuta", "fullName": "Brandon Anesu Mavuta", "displayName": "Brandon Mavuta"}, "team": {"id": "9", "name": "Zimbabwe", "abbreviation": "ZIM", "displayName": "Zimbabwe"}, "totalRuns": 9, "faced": 9, "fours": 0, "runs": 246, "sixes": 0}, "otherBatsman": {"athlete": {"id": "392945", "name": "Donald Tiripano", "shortName": "Tiripano", "fullName": "Donald Tatenda Tiripano", "displayName": "Donald Tiripano"}, "team": {"id": "9", "name": "Zimbabwe", "abbreviation": "ZIM", "displayName": "Zimbabwe"}, "totalRuns": 3, "faced": 7, "fours": 0, "runs": 0, "sixes": 0}, "innings": {"id": "209702", "runRate": 4.92, "remainingBalls": 0, "byes": 0, "number": 1, "balls": 300, "noBalls": 0, "wickets": 7, "legByes": 0, "ballLimit": 300, "target": 0, "session": 1, "day": 1, "fallOfWickets": 0, "remainingOvers": 0.0, "totalRuns": 2, "wides": 0, "runs": 246}, "over": {"ball": 6, "balls": 6, "complete": true, "limit": 50.0, "maiden": 0, "noBall": 0, "wide": 0, "byes": 0, "legByes": 0, "number": 50, "runs": 8, "wickets": 0, "overs": 49.6, "actual": 49.6, "unique": 49.06}, "dismissal": {"dismissal": false, "bowled": false, "type": "", "bowler": {"athlete": {"id": "629070", "name": "Mohammad Saifuddin", "shortName": "Saifuddin", "fullName": "Mohammad Saifuddin", "displayName": "Mohammad Saifuddin"}}, "batsman": {"athlete": {"id": "806239", "name": "Brandon Mavuta", "shortName": "Mavuta", "fullName": "Brandon Anesu Mavuta", "displayName": "Brandon Mavuta"}}, "fielder": {"athlete": {}}, "minutes": 0, "retiredText": ""}}]}}
