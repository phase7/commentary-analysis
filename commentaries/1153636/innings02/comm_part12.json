Mohammad Saifuddin, playing in only his second ODI, picked three wickets to play a key role in bottling up pressure and scything through with the wickets after Brendan Taylor top scored with 75. Then with the chase, Imrul Kayes and Liton Das helped make light work of the chase by putting together 144. Both missed out on richly-deserved centuries, but by then, there was little doubt as to which side was favourite to win. Zimbabwe have a lot of soul-searching to do.\n\n<b> Mohammad Saifuddin </b> is Player of the Match for his three-wicket haul\n\n<b> Mashrafe Mortaza: </b> Winning the toss was crucial. We knew about the dew, but the bowlers were superb. Our openers started very well, this was a good wicket and we knew 270-280 was gettable. \n\n<b> Hamilton Masakadza: </b> Didn't manage to kick on after a good start, credit to Bangladesh's death  bowling.
